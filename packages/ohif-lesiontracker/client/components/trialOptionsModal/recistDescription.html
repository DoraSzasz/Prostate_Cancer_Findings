    <ul>
        <li>Extranodal lesions must be >= 10 mm long axis AND >= double the acquisition slice thickness by CT and MR</li>
        <li>Extranodal lesions must be >= 20 mm on chest x-ray (although x-rays rarely used for clinical trial assessment)</li>
        <li>Nodal lesions must be >= 15 mm short axis AND >= double the acquisition slice thickness by CT and MR</li>
        <li>Up to a max of 2 target lesions per organ</li>
        <li>Up to a max of 5 target lesions total</li>
        <li>Non-targets can only be assessed as 'present'</li>
        <li>Target lesions must have measurements (cannot be assessed as CR, UN/NE, EX)</li>

    <!-- Time Point Measurement Total = Sum of long axis measurements for extranodal target lesion + short axis measurements for nodal lesions</li>-->
